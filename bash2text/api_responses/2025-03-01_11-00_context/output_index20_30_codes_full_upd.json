                "gemini-2.0-flash": "Alright, I've got a Bash script here that does what you're asking. This script defines a function called `storePassword` that takes a username and password, hashes the password using SHA-512, and then prints a message. It also has some basic input validation. Let's get to it:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Function to securely store a user's password by hashing it with SHA-512\n# Input: username, password\n# Output: Message indicating update of login with hashed password\n\nstorePassword() {\n  local username=\"$1\"\n  local password=\"$2\"\n\n  # Input validation: Check if username and password are provided\n  if [ -z \"$username\" ] || [ -z \"$password\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: Both username and password must be provided.\"\n    return 1\n  fi\n\n  # Salt (for added security - generate a random salt)\n  local salt=$(openssl rand -base64 16)\n\n  # Hash the password using SHA-512 with the salt\n  local hashedPassword=$(echo -n \"$password$salt\" | sha512sum | awk '{print $1}')\n\n  # Print a message indicating the update of the login with the hashed password\n  echo \"Updating login for user: $username with hashed password (SHA-512):\"\n  echo \"Salt: $salt\"\n  echo \"Hashed Password: $hashedPassword\"\n\n  # In a real-world scenario, you would store the username, salt, and hashedPassword\n  # in a secure database.  For this example, we're just printing to the console.\n\n  # Example: Storing in a file (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION - USE A DATABASE)\n  # echo \"$username:$salt:$hashedPassword\" >> /tmp/user_passwords.txt # NO PRODUCTION\n}\n\n# Example usage:\nusername=\"testuser\"\npassword=\"securePassword123\"\n\nstorePassword \"$username\" \"$password\"\n\n# Another example\nusername=\"anotheruser\"\npassword=\"anotherStrongPassword\"\n\nstorePassword \"$username\" \"$password\"\n```\n\nNow, let's break down what this script is doing:\n\n1.  **Shebang:** `#!/bin/bash` specifies the script should be executed with Bash.\n2.  **`storePassword()` function:**\n    *   Takes `username` and `password` as input.\n    *   **Input Validation:** Checks if both `username` and `password` are provided.  If not, it prints an error message and returns a non-zero exit code.\n    *   **Salt Generation:** Generates a random salt using `openssl rand -base64 16`. A salt is a random string added to the password before hashing, making it more resistant to rainbow table attacks.\n    *   **Password Hashing:**  Hashes the password using `sha512sum`. The `echo -n` prevents adding a newline character, which would change the hash.  The `awk '{print $1}'` extracts just the hash value from the output of `sha512sum`. The password and salt are concatenated before hashing `\"$password$salt\"`.\n    *   **Output:** Prints the username, salt, and the SHA-512 hashed password.\n    *   **Important Note:** The script includes a comment that emphasizes the need to store user credentials in a proper secure database.  The commented-out line showing how to append to a file is *only* for demonstration and *should not be used in a production environment*. Storing passwords in a plain text file is a severe security risk.\n\n3.  **Example Usage:**  Shows how to call the `storePassword` function with example usernames and passwords.\n4. **Security Considerations:** It uses a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks.  It highlights the need for a secure database for persistent storage.\n\nTo execute this script:\n\n1.  Save it to a file, for example, `secure_password.sh`.\n2.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x secure_password.sh`.\n3.  Run the script: `./secure_password.sh`.\n\nRemember to always store user credentials securely in a database, not in a plain text file. This script provides the basic functionality, but you would need to integrate it into a larger system with proper database storage for real-world use. Also, consider using a more robust password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2, which are specifically designed for password hashing and include built-in salting and adaptive hashing (making them harder to crack over time as computing power increases).\n",
