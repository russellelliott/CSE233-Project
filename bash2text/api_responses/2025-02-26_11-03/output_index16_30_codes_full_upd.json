The `check_user_credentials` function is defined, taking two arguments `username` and `password`.\n2. The local variables `stored_username` and `stored_password` are set to \"admin\" and \"secret\", respectively.\n3. The function checks if the `username` argument matches the `stored_username` variable. Since \"new-admin\" != \"admin\", the condition is false.\n4. The function echoes \"Unknown username\" and returns 0 (indicating failure).\n\nThe reason `echo \"success\"` and `return 1` are never reached is because the condition `if [ \"$username\" == \"$stored_username\" ];` isn't met.",

It compares the input credentials against hardcoded `stored_username` and `stored_password`.\n\nIn this specific execution, the function is called with `username=\"new-admin\"` and `password=\"secret\"`.\n\nThe `if [ \"$username\" == \"$stored_username\" ]; then` condition checks if the input username matches the stored username (\"admin\"). Since \"new-admin\" is not equal to \"admin\", the `else` block is executed.\n\nThe `else` block contains the statement `echo \"Unknown username\"` which prints \"Unknown username\" to the standard output.\n\nFinally, `return 0` is executed, indicating that the function completed with a failure status (conventionally, 0 means success and non-zero means failure in bash).\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nUnknown username\n```\n",

                "llama3-8b-8192": "Here is the Bash script that defines the function and calls it:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncheck_credentials() {\n  local username=\"admin\"\n  local password=\"correct_password\"\n  \n  if [ \"$1\" = \"$username\" ] && [ \"$2\" = \"$password\" ]; then\n    echo \"success\"\n  elif [ \"$1\" != \"$username\" ]; then\n    echo \"Unknown username\"\n  else\n    echo \"Wrong password\"\n  fi\n}\n\ncheck_credentials \"new-admin\" \"secret\"\n```\nLet me explain what the script does:\n\n1. The first line, `#!/bin/bash`, specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script.\n2. The `check_credentials` function is defined. It takes two arguments, `$1` and `$2`, which are the username and password passed to the function.\n3. Inside the function, we define the expected username and password (`admin` and `correct_password`, respectively) as local variables.\n4. The function checks if the provided username and password match the expected values. If both match, it returns \"success\".\n5. If the username is incorrect, but the password is correct, it returns \"Unknown username\".\n6. If the password is incorrect, regardless of the username, it returns \"Wrong password\".\n7. Finally, the script calls the `check_credentials` function with the username \"new-admin\" and password \"secret\", and prints the result to the console.\n\nTo execute the script, save it to a file (e.g., `check_credentials.sh`), make the file executable with `chmod +x check_credentials.sh`, and then run it with `./check_credentials.sh`.",
                "gemini-2.0-flash": "```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Function to check user credentials\ncheck_credentials() {\n  local username=\"$1\"\n  local password=\"$2\"\n\n  # Predefined username and password\n  ADMIN_USERNAME=\"new-admin\"\n  ADMIN_PASSWORD=\"secret\"\n\n  if [ \"$username\" == \"$ADMIN_USERNAME\" ]; then\n    if [ \"$password\" == \"$ADMIN_PASSWORD\" ]; then\n      echo \"success\"\n    else\n      echo \"Wrong password\"\n    fi\n  else\n    echo \"Unknown username\"\n  fi\n}\n\n# Call the function with username \"new-admin\" and password \"secret\"\nresult=$(check_credentials \"new-admin\" \"secret\")\n\n# Print the result\necho \"$result\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`#!/bin/bash`**: Shebang line indicating the script should be executed with bash.\n2. **`check_credentials() { ... }`**: Defines a function named `check_credentials` that takes two arguments: username and password.\n3. **`local username=\"$1\"` and `local password=\"$2\"`**:  Assigns the function arguments to local variables `username` and `password`.  Using `local` makes these variables only accessible within the function, preventing potential conflicts with variables outside the function.  Quoting the variables (`\"$1\"`, `\"$2\"`) protects against word splitting and globbing if the arguments contain spaces or special characters.\n4. **`ADMIN_USERNAME=\"new-admin\"` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD=\"secret\"`**: Defines predefined username and password values. These could be read from a file or database in a real-world scenario for better security.\n5. **`if [ \"$username\" == \"$ADMIN_USERNAME\" ]; then ... fi`**: Checks if the provided username matches the predefined username.  The `[ ... ]` is a test command.\n6. **`if [ \"$password\" == \"$ADMIN_PASSWORD\" ]; then ... fi`**: If the username matches, it checks if the provided password matches the predefined password.\n7. **`echo \"success\"`, `echo \"Wrong password\"`, `echo \"Unknown username\"`**: Based on the checks, the function prints the appropriate message to standard output.\n8. **`result=$(check_credentials \"new-admin\" \"secret\")`**: Calls the `check_credentials` function with the username \"new-admin\" and password \"secret\", and captures the output of the function into the `result` variable using command substitution (`$(...)`).\n9. **`echo \"$result\"`**: Prints the value of the `result` variable (which will be either \"success\", \"Wrong password\", or \"Unknown username\").  Quoting `\"$result\"` handles cases where the result might contain spaces or special characters.\n\n**How to execute the script:**\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code above to a file, for example, `check_user.sh`.\n2.  **Make the script executable:**  Run the following command in your terminal:\n    ```bash\n    chmod +x check_user.sh\n    ```\n3.  **Execute the script:** Run the script using:\n    ```bash\n    ./check_user.sh\n    ```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nsuccess\n```\n\nIf you change the username or password in the `check_credentials` call, the output will change accordingly. For example:\n\n*   `./check_user.sh` with `check_credentials \"new-admin\" \"wrongpassword\"` will output `Wrong password`.\n*   `./check_user.sh` with `check_credentials \"unknownuser\" \"secret\"` will output `Unknown username`.\n\n**Important Security Note:** This script is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment. Storing usernames and passwords directly in a script is highly insecure. Real-world authentication systems use secure password hashing algorithms, database storage, and other security measures to protect user credentials.  Consider using tools like `openssl passwd` for generating password hashes.\n",

                "gemini-2.0-flash": "```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Function to verify user credentials\ncheck_user_credentials() {\n  username=\"$1\"\n  password=\"$2\"\n\n  local stored_username=\"admin\"\n  local stored_password=\"secret\"\n\n  if [ \"$username\" = \"$stored_username\" ]; then\n    if [ \"$password\" = \"$stored_password\" ]; then\n      echo \"success\"\n      return 1  # Authentication success\n    else\n      echo \"Wrong password\"\n      return 0  # Authentication failure\n    fi\n  else\n    echo \"Unknown username\"\n    return 0  # Authentication failure\n  fi\n}\n\n# Call the function with example username and password\ncheck_user_credentials \"new-admin\" \"secret\"\n\n# Optionally, check the return code of the function\nif [ $? -eq 1 ]; then\n  echo \"Authentication successful (main script)\"\nelse\n  echo \"Authentication failed (main script)\"\nfi\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Shebang:** `#!/bin/bash` specifies the interpreter for the script (Bash).\n2. **Function Definition:**\n   - `check_user_credentials() { ... }` defines a function named `check_user_credentials`.\n   - `$1` and `$2` inside the function refer to the first and second arguments passed to the function (username and password, respectively).\n   - `local` keyword ensures that `stored_username` and `stored_password` are local to the function's scope. This prevents them from accidentally overwriting variables outside the function.\n3. **Authentication Logic:**\n   - `if [ \"$username\" = \"$stored_username\" ]; then ...` checks if the provided username matches the stored username.  It's important to use double quotes around variables in conditional statements to avoid issues with spaces or empty values.\n   - `if [ \"$password\" = \"$stored_password\" ]; then ...` checks if the provided password matches the stored password (only if the username matches).\n   - `echo \"success\"` prints \"success\" if both username and password match.\n   - `return 1` returns an exit code of 1, indicating success.  In Bash, a non-zero exit code typically signifies an error. However, we're using `1` to signal successful authentication in this context.\n   - `echo \"Wrong password\"` prints \"Wrong password\" if the username is correct but the password is not.\n   - `return 0` returns an exit code of 0, indicating failure.\n   - `echo \"Unknown username\"` prints \"Unknown username\" if the username is not found.\n   - `return 0` returns an exit code of 0, indicating failure.\n4. **Function Call:**\n   - `check_user_credentials \"new-admin\" \"secret\"` calls the `check_user_credentials` function with the username \"new-admin\" and the password \"secret\".\n5. **Return Code Check (Optional):**\n   - `if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then ...` checks the exit code of the last command executed (which is the function call).  `$?` is a special variable that holds the exit code of the previous command.\n   - If the exit code is 1 (successful authentication), it prints \"Authentication successful (main script)\".\n   - Otherwise (if the exit code is 0, indicating failure), it prints \"Authentication failed (main script)\".\n\n**How to Run the Script:**\n\n1. **Save:** Save the code to a file, for example, `authenticate.sh`.\n2. **Make Executable:**  Run `chmod +x authenticate.sh` in your terminal to make the script executable.\n3. **Execute:** Run `./authenticate.sh` in your terminal.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nUnknown username\nAuthentication failed (main script)\n```\n\nBecause the username \"new-admin\" does not match the stored username \"admin\", the output reflects the `Unknown username` case.  If you change the username in the function call to \"admin\", you would get the \"Wrong password\" message, and then \"success\" if you also change the password to \"secret\".\n",
