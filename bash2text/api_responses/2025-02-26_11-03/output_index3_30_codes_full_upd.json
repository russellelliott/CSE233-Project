It calls the `fetch_url_content` function with this URL as the argument and stores the returned content (the HTML source code of the page) in the `content` variable.\n\nFinally, it prints the value of the `content` variable to standard output.  In this case, the contents of the HTML file at the specified URL, a simple HTML page containing the string \"This page is abusive\". will be output to the console.\n\nTherefore, when executed, the script will download the content of \"https://1mocat.github.io/abusive.html\" and print it to the console.

We define a bash function named `fetch_url_content` that takes one argument. The function assigns the first argument to a local variable `url`.\n2. The function uses `curl` with the `-s` option to fetch the content from the URL stored in the `url` variable. The `-s` option tells `curl` to be silent and not show progress meter or error messages.

Using `local` ensures the variable's scope is limited to the function.\n   - **`local content`**: Declares a local variable `content`.\n   - **`content=$(curl -s \"$url\")`**:  This is the core part of the function.  It executes the `curl` command to fetch the content from the URL specified in the `url` variable.\n     - `curl`: A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.\n     - `-s`:  The \"silent\" option.  It tells `curl` to suppress progress meters, error messages, and other extraneous output.  This is important because we only want the actual HTML content to be captured.\n     - `\"$url\"`:  Passes the URL to `curl`.  The double quotes are important to prevent word splitting and globbing if the URL contains spaces or special characters.\n     - `$(...)`: Command substitution. This captures the standard output (stdout) of the `curl` command and assigns it to the `content` variable.\n   - **`echo \"$content\"`**:  Prints the content fetched by `curl` to the standard output (stdout).
