The stored credentials are \"admin\" for the username and \"secret\" for the password.\n\nHere is the output of the script:\n\n```\nUnknown username\n```\n\nThe reason for this is that the function is checking for an exact match of the provided username and the stored username, which is \"admin\". The provided username is \"new-admin\", which does not match the stored username. Therefore, the function returns an \"Unknown username\" message.\n\nIf you want to modify the script to accept usernames with a prefix of \"admin\", you can modify the if statement inside the function like this:\n\n```\nif [ \"${username}\" == \"admin\"* ]; then\n```\n\nThis will match if the provided username starts with \"admin\".",

It compares the provided credentials against hardcoded values for a stored username (\"admin\") and password (\"secret\").\n\nIn the main part of the script, the `check_user_credentials` function is called with the username \"new-admin\" and the password \"secret\".\n\nBecause \"new-admin\" is not equal to the stored username \"admin\", the `else` block of the first `if` statement is executed.  This results in the script printing \"Unknown username\" to standard output and returning a status code of 0.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nUnknown username\n```\n",

            "Summary": {
                "llama3-8b-8192": "Here is the bash script that defines the function and calls it with the provided credentials:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Define the function to check user credentials\ncheck_credentials() {\n    local username=$1\n    local password=$2\n    \n    if [ \"$username\" = \"new-admin\" ]; then\n        if [ \"$password\" = \"secret\" ]; then\n            echo \"success\"\n        else\n            echo \"Wrong password\"\n        fi\n    else\n        echo \"Unknown username\"\n    fi\n}\n\n# Call the function with the provided credentials\ncheck_credentials \"new-admin\" \"secret\"\n```\n\nLet me explain what each part of the code does:\n\n1. The first line `#!/bin/bash` is the shebang, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script.\n\n2. The next few lines define the function `check_credentials`. This function takes two arguments, `username` and `password`, and checks if they match the predefined values.\n\n3. Inside the function, we first check if the `username` is \"new-admin\". If it is, we then check if the `password` is \"secret\". If both conditions are true, we print \"success\". If the `password` is not \"secret\", we print \"Wrong password\". If the `username` is not \"new-admin\", we print \"Unknown username\".\n\n4. Lastly, we call the `check_credentials` function with the username \"new-admin\" and password \"secret\".\n\nTo execute this script, save it to a file (e.g., `credentials.sh`), then run it with the command `./credentials.sh`.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example and in a real-world scenario, you should not store credentials directly in your script. Instead, you would typically store them in a secure location or ask the user to enter them.",
                "gemini-2.0-flash": "```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Function to check user credentials\ncheck_credentials() {\n  local username=$1\n  local password=$2\n\n  # Predefined user credentials (replace with your actual users)\n  known_username=\"new-admin\"\n  known_password=\"secret\"\n\n  if [[ \"$username\" == \"$known_username\" ]]; then\n    if [[ \"$password\" == \"$known_password\" ]]; then\n      echo \"success\"\n    else\n      echo \"Wrong password\"\n    fi\n  else\n    echo \"Unknown username\"\n  fi\n}\n\n# Main script\n\n# Call the function with username \"new-admin\" and password \"secret\"\nresult=$(check_credentials \"new-admin\" \"secret\")\n\n# Print the result\necho \"Result: $result\"\n\n# Example with incorrect password\nresult=$(check_credentials \"new-admin\" \"wrongpassword\")\necho \"Result: $result\"\n\n# Example with unknown username\nresult=$(check_credentials \"unknownuser\" \"secret\")\necho \"Result: $result\"\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`#!/bin/bash`**:  Shebang line, specifies the interpreter for the script (Bash).\n2. **`check_credentials() { ... }`**: Defines a function named `check_credentials`. This function takes two arguments:\n   - `$1`:  The username passed to the function.\n   - `$2`:  The password passed to the function.\n3. **`local username=$1`** and **`local password=$2`**:  Assign the function arguments to local variables. `local` ensures that these variables are only accessible within the function, preventing potential conflicts with variables in the main script.\n4. **`known_username=\"new-admin\"`** and **`known_password=\"secret\"`**: Define the predefined username and password for comparison.  **IMPORTANT:  In a real-world scenario, NEVER store passwords in plain text in the script.  Use proper hashing and salting techniques.**\n5. **`if [[ \"$username\" == \"$known_username\" ]]`**:  Checks if the provided username matches the known username.  The `[[ ... ]]` construct is a more robust form of conditional expression in Bash.\n6. **`if [[ \"$password\" == \"$known_password\" ]]`**: If the username matches, it checks if the provided password matches the known password.\n7. **`echo \"success\"`**, **`echo \"Wrong password\"`**, **`echo \"Unknown username\"`**:  Based on the username and password comparison, the function prints the appropriate status message.\n8. **`result=$(check_credentials \"new-admin\" \"secret\")`**: Calls the `check_credentials` function with the username \"new-admin\" and password \"secret\".  The output of the function is captured and stored in the `result` variable using command substitution (`$(...)`).\n9. **`echo \"Result: $result\"`**:  Prints the value of the `result` variable.\n10. **Example with incorrect password and unknown username**:  The script then provides two more examples with incorrect password and unknown username, demonstrating how the function handles these scenarios.\n\n**How to Execute:**\n\n1. **Save the code:** Save the code to a file, for example, `credentials.sh`.\n2. **Make it executable:** `chmod +x credentials.sh`\n3. **Run the script:** `./credentials.sh`\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nResult: success\nResult: Wrong password\nResult: Unknown username\n```\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Never store passwords in plain text:** This script is for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world application, you *must* use proper password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) and salting techniques to securely store passwords.  Storing plain text passwords is a severe security vulnerability.\n* **Avoid hardcoding credentials:** Ideally, configuration data like usernames and passwords should be stored in a separate configuration file or environment variables, not hardcoded in the script. This makes it easier to update credentials without modifying the code.\n* **Input validation:**  Consider adding input validation to prevent malicious usernames or passwords from causing unexpected behavior.\n* **Authentication mechanisms:** For more robust security, integrate with established authentication mechanisms like PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules).\n* **Permissions:**  Ensure that the script has the necessary permissions to access any required resources (e.g., a database containing user credentials).  Be careful not to grant excessive permissions.\n",

The first line, `#!/bin/bash`, specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script.\n2. The `check_user_credentials` function is defined. It takes two parameters, `$1` and `$2`, which represent the `username` and `password` respectively.\n3. Inside the function, we set the local variables `stored_username` and `stored_password` to predefined values \"admin\" and \"secret\" respectively.\n4. We check if the provided `username` matches the `stored_username` using the `==` operator. If true, we enter the `then` block.\n5. Inside the `then` block, we check if the provided `password` matches the `stored_password` using the `==` operator. If true, we print \"success\" and return 1 to indicate successful authentication. If not, we print \"Wrong password\" and return 0 to indicate authentication failure.\n6. If the `username` does not match the `stored_username`, we print \"Unknown username\" and return 0 to indicate authentication failure.\n7. Finally, we call the `check_user_credentials` function with the arguments \"new-admin\" for the username and \"secret\" for the password.\n\nNote that this script is very basic and should not be used in production without additional security measures (e.g., hashing passwords, validating input, etc.).",

It takes two arguments, which are accessed within the function using `$1` (username) and `$2` (password).\n3. **`local stored_username=\"admin\"` and `local stored_password=\"secret\"`**:  Declares local variables `stored_username` and `stored_password` and initializes them with the predefined credentials.  Using `local` ensures that these variables are only accessible within the `check_user_credentials` function, preventing accidental modification from outside the function.\n4. **`if [ \"$username\" = \"$stored_username\" ]; then ... fi`**:  Compares the provided `username` with the `stored_username`. The double quotes around the variables are important to handle cases where the variables might be empty or contain spaces.\n5. **`if [ \"$password\" = \"$stored_password\" ]; then ... fi`**:  If the username matches, this nested `if` statement compares the provided `password` with the `stored_password`.\n6. **`echo \"success\"` / `echo \"Wrong password\"` / `echo \"Unknown username\"`**:  Prints the appropriate message based on the authentication result.\n7. **`return 1` / `return 0`**:  Sets the exit status of the function. A return value of 1 conventionally signifies success, and 0 signifies failure in this context. This can be useful for further processing of the authentication result, as shown in the commented out code.\n8. **`check_user_credentials \"new-admin\" \"secret\"`**:  Calls the `check_user_credentials` function with the username \"new-admin\" and the password \"secret\" as arguments.  Since \"new-admin\" does not match the stored username \"admin\", the \"Unknown username\" message will be printed.\n9. **`# if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then ... fi`**:  This is commented-out code that demonstrates how you can check the return value of the function using the special variable `$?`.  `$?` holds the exit status of the last executed command.  You could use this to perform actions based on whether the authentication was successful or not.\n\n**How to Execute the Script:**\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code above as a file, for example, `authenticate.sh`.\n2.  **Make the script executable:** Open a terminal and run the command `chmod +x authenticate.sh`.\n3.  **Run the script:** Execute the script using `./authenticate.sh`.\n\nThe output of the script will be:\n\n```\nUnknown username\n```\n",
