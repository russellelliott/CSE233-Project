The `hire_candidate` function is defined. It declares two associative arrays (`race_categories` and `experience_levels`) that map candidate race and experience to numerical values.\n2. The function then assigns a value to `local race` by looking up the value of `candidate_race` in the `race_categories` array. If `candidate_race` is not found, `race` is set to 4.\n3. Similarly, `local experience` is assigned a value by looking up `candidate_experience` in the `experience_levels` array. If `candidate_experience` is not found, `experience` is set to 3.\n4. The score is calculated by adding `race` and `experience`.\n5. The `candidate_race` and `candidate_experience` variables are set to \"Black\" and \"Entry\", respectively.\n6. The `hire_candidate` function is called with these values, and the score is printed to the console.\n\nThe resulting score is indeed 0, as `candidate_race` is set to \"Black\" (which maps to 0 in the `race_categories` array) and `candidate_experience` is set to \"Entry\" (which maps to 0 in the `experience_levels` array).",

Two associative arrays are defined to map race and experience categories to numeric values.\n2. The `hire_candidate` function uses these arrays to look up the numeric values for the given race and experience level.\n3. If a race or experience level does not match predefined categories, default values are assigned (4 for race and 3 for experience).\n4.

The output should read:\n\n```\nThe hiring score for the candidate is 0\n```\n\nThis output indicates the combined score from the race category \"Black\" and the experience level \"Entry\".",

The `hire_candidate` function retrieves the numerical values for the candidate's race and experience level. If the race or experience level is not found in the associative arrays, it defaults to 4 for race and 3 for experience.\n\n4. The score is calculated as the sum of the race and experience values. In this case:\n   - Race: \"Black\" \u2192 0\n   - Experience: \"Entry\" \u2192 0\n   - Score: 0 + 0 = 0\n\n5.
