It then calculates the SHA512 hash of the password without using a salt, and prints an update message to standard output indicating the username and the generated password hash.  Finally, the script calls `storePassword` with the username \"noSaltGenUser\" and the password \"noSaltPwd\". The output will display the SHA512 hash of \"noSaltPwd\".\n",

The script defines a function `storePassword` that takes two arguments: `userName` and `Password`.\n2. Inside the function, the `Password` is hashed using the SHA-512 algorithm. The `echo -n` ensures that no newline is added to the input, which is important for consistent hashing.\n3. The `sha512sum` command generates the hash, and `awk '{print $1}'` extracts the hash value from the output.\n4. The script then prints a message indicating that the login for the specified user is being updated with the hashed password.\n5. Finally, the function is called with the arguments `\"noSaltGenUser\"` and `\"noSaltPwd\"`.\n\n### Output:\nWhen executed, the script will output something like:\n```\nUpdating login for noSaltGenUser with password <hashed_password>\n```\nWhere `<hashed_password>` is the SHA-512 hash of the string `\"noSaltPwd\"`.\n\nIf you need further assistance or modifications, let me know."
